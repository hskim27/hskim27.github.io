Welcome to my webpage! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Indiana University Bloomington.  

My research interests lie in _Empirical Macroeconomics, Climate Economics, and Applied Time-Series Econometrics_. I am particularly interested in studying the macroeconomic effects of climate change using time-series methods. 

I will be on the job market in the academic year 2024-2025 and expect to graduate in May 2025.
