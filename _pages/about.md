Welcome to my webpage! 

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at Indiana University Bloomington and will be joining the University of Texas at El Paso as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025. 

My research interests lie in _Empirical Macroeconomics, Climate Economics, and Applied Time-Series Econometrics_. I am particularly interested in studying the macroeconomic effects of climate change using time-series methods.
